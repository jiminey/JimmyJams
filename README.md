# Features 

### <u>User authorization </u>

Users can create an account or use the demo login functionality. I implemented user authentication with indicative validation errors that utilizes BCrypt salts in which resulted in strengthened security.

### <u> Song interaction </u>

Users can upload, delete, and listen to songs on the site (SONG CRUD). I constructed top-level music player that integrated Reduxâ€™s global store with conditional logic and AWS S3 to fetch audio data in the form of JSON objects, thus ensuring for persistent music streaming during navigation. 

### <u> Music player interaction </u>

Users can pause, play and skip through points of a song with the seekbar. I constructed a seekbar that changes the current time of the song based on the position of the mouse relative to the seekbar through on-click event listeners.

### <u> Search interaction </u>

Users can search their favorite song non-case sensitive through the search bar.
